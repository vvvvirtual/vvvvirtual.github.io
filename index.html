    <h1>VVVVirtual: The Art and Philosophy of Chaos, Chance and Computational Error</h1>
    <p>Hello Everyone! Ed here, the creator of the vvvvirtual course (pronounced 'v4virtual' pun intended).<br><br>

This course is meant to provide an introduction to many topics at once, including but not limited to complexity, new media art, <br> post-structuralist philosophy, applications of high school math and computational music etc. We'll be working through the lens <br> of  a Chapter-wise reading of Deleuze and Guattari's <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i> as well as making Glitch art with VVVV gamma<br><br>

Why such a broad sweep?<br><br>

For a lot of people, school as an institution has become a place dedicated to, in my opinion, not the production of good sensibility, <br>but absolute stupidity, due to its insistence of adherence to rules, regulations and authority, all aspects antithetical to the ideal of <br>true creative ability. Thus, most people come out of school feeling like they're stupid, talentless and afraid of mistakes. This last<br> point, in my opinion, is extremely dangerous, because it's through mistakes, chances and errors that life on Earth learns and <br>thus evolves. A society that doesn't stray, cannot grow. Deleuze, Chaos theory and Glitch art are three domains that I belive espouse <br>this approach to life in the most beautiful manner, for if we don't take a chance at life, how can we know what we could ever truly <br>become as people?<br><br>

VVVV gamma is the primary means through which I'll be taking this course, so I'd recommend getting that installed. <br>It would also help to take chkworks' VVVV course "The Bigbang" to navigate the software better, but that's up to you.</p>
